## Problem

Quarto HTML document does not display image downloaded from a publicly accessible cloud share provider (here: [Keeper](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/)).

## Example

Here is the link to the Keeper logo: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)

I can embed it in Markdown using the `![]()` Markdown syntax:

```
![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)
```

![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)

Here is the link to the same logo, stored in a Keeper library: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/)

Again, I want to embed it in Markdown using the [direct download link](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1):

```
![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1)
```

![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1)

Can you see the logo?

No, right?

But the same thing works for the [README.md](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/keeper-image/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.

Why?
