This is the link to the Keeper logo: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)

Here is the link to the same logo, stored in a Keeper library: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/)

We embed it using the [direct download link](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1):
