The source repository of this website can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/keeper-image/).

The problem described on this website is also [documented as an issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4640) on the `quarto-cli` GitHub repository.

## Problem

Quarto HTML document does not display image downloaded from a publicly accessible cloud share provider (here: [Keeper](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/)).

## Example

Here is the link to the Keeper logo: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)

I can embed it in Markdown using the `![]()` Markdown syntax:

```
![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)
```

![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/media/custom/KeeperLogo.svg)

Here is the link to the same logo, stored in a Keeper library: [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/)

Again, I want to embed it in Markdown using the [direct download link](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1):

```
![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1)
```

![](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1)

Can you see the logo?

No, right?

But the same thing works for the [README.md](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/keeper-image/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub ...

:::{#hero-heading}
... and also for the link provided to the `image` field in the YAML header when using the [About Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) template.

**Why?**

## Workaround: Pre-render

One workaround is to execute a script that downloads images from the cloud storage as part of the [`pre-render` options in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render).

Here is one approach:

1. We create a Makefile command `prepare` that uses `wget` to download the image from Keeper:

  ```Makefile
  prepare:
  	wget https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/ec510a79d3ab495eaf67/?dl=1 -O KeeperLogo.svg
  ```

2. We include `pre-render: make prepare` in `_quarto.yml`

3. We include a path to the downloaded file:

  ```markdown
  ![](KeeperLogo.svg)
  ```

This is the outcome:

![](KeeperLogo.svg)

Cool! ðŸŽ‰
